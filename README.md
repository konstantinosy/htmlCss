## HTML, github pages and a touch of css.

This repository contains the final project of html. It contains a main page [index.html](https://github.com/konstantinosy/html-css-page/blob/main/index.html) which links to two (2) other pages:

* [birthday-invite.html](https://github.com/konstantinosy/html-css-page/blob/main/public/birthday-invite.html) (A simple page featuring a birthday invitation),

* [movie-ranking.html](https://github.com/konstantinosy/html-css-page/blob/main/public/movie-ranking.html) (A page featuring three movies and links to IMDB / Rotten Tomatoes),

Additionally, it contains some simple CSS in the [style.css](https://github.com/konstantinosy/html-css-page/blob/main/style.css) file that alters the font-family, color and font-shadow for various elements although it is out of this project scope.

Lastly, this page is hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
